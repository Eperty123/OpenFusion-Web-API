# OpenFusion-Web-API
A web API for Open Fusion (Fusionfall) written in PHP.

# Features
- Fully written in PHP
- Handles login (for now but more to come..)


# Usage
Configure settings inside inc/config.php. It's still a work in progress so a bunch of features are missing and expect bugs and unoptimized code.

It handles login at the moment.
